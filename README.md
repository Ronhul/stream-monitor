- Simple interface to add and remove streams
- All streams muted by default

## Usage

### Adding Streams

1. Click the "+ Add Stream" button
2. Select the stream type (YouTube, Twitch, or Telegram)
3. Enter the URL of the stream
4. Click "Add Stream"

### Managing Streams

- Click the mute/unmute button (üîá/üîä) to toggle audio for a particular stream
- Click the remove button (‚ùå) to remove a stream from the view

## Technical Implementation

- Built with React
- Uses Web Audio API for sound level visualization
- Responsive layout that adjusts according to the number of active streams
- Containerized iframes for external stream sources

## Getting Started

To run this application locally:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

### Running in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you're using WSL and encounter path-related issues, you have multiple options:

**Option 1: Use the cross-platform Node.js script (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run start-js
```
This approach uses a custom Node.js script that works across all platforms including WSL.

**Option 2: Use the direct Node approach**
```bash
npm run start-wsl
```
This bypasses some of the path resolution issues by directly running the start script.

**Option 4: Use the Windows batch file (from Windows Command Prompt)**
```cmd
start-windows.bat
```
Run this from Windows Command Prompt or by double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer.

**Option 5: Run the VS Code task**
Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, select "Tasks: Run Task", then choose "Start StreamMonitor (WSL Compatible)"
